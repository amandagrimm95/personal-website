                        <p>
                            This website was designed and constructed for a client as a 
                            informational site as well as store-front for her fitness and nutrition buisiness. 
                            It was built off the kajabi frame-work to seamlessly transition between
                            the site and the online classes/products.

                        <p>
                            The purpose of this project was to combine preliminary JavaScript
                            and HTML. This simple program produces a randomized fortune whenever
                            the user clicks on the image of the fortune cookie. Give it a try!

                        <p>
                            This project started to combine HTML with the styling of CSS. This
                            touched on basic styling of text and images while keeping the default
                            flow of the website.
                        </p>
                    <h4>Tea Cozy - <a href="https://amandagrimm95.github.io/tea-cozy/">Responsive Website</a></h4>
                        <p>
                            In this project, I worked off of a "client provided" style sheet <a href="">(see here)</a> to 
                            build a website meeting their specs. I then tweeked the styling using mobile query 
                            to make it adaptable based on screen size using the <strong>Flexbox</strong> tool.  Try it out on anything from your computer to your phone to see!

            <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Amanda Grimm.  I originally went to school for Multidisciplinary Engineering
                    and Technical Theatre with the goal of working in live entertainment and amusement park design.
                    I was fortunate enough to fulfil that dream, but when the COVID-19 pandemic hit the 
                    entertainment industry started to slow down.  I used that time to discover a new passion,
                    coding.  I have always enjoyed creating tools to increase efficiency and help with more 
                    repetitive tasks, and I am excited to shift into this industry and continue to explore
                    this passion. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I graduated from Purdue University in 2018 and moved to Upstate NY with my now fiance.
                    Since then we have really made a home for ourselves in New York.  We love being surrounded
                    by the beautiful mountains, a nice change of pace for a couple of kids from the flat mid-west.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In our free time we love to play games of all kinds, from board games with local friends
                    to video games with friends and family accorss the country.  I also love to do anything that 
                    allows me to work with my hands and use some creativity including baking, crocheting, drawing, and painting.
